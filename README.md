# Pharmaceutical-Refinement-Pipeline
This is a project to develop a full stack research pipeline for creating, testing, and refining ligands that specifically bind to a previously discovered location. 

Currently utilizes AutoGrow 3.1.3 as the backbone for the algorithm; however, it is being updated for newer technologies and less dependencies. It is also being face-lifted with a GUI and newer implementations of other docking software. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not affiliated with the development team at AutoGrow. I am thankful that they keep their software open-sourced to allow for projects like this. However, on my end, I will keep most of software I develop closed-source to protect my research groups intellectual property rights. If there is an inquistion as to where the project is currectly at, please reach out to me.
